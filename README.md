ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm ðŸ”¥RedFlameKen!ðŸ”¥ I'm from Pasay City, Philippines.

As my first language, i'm very good at Java. So if you need help with your open source java projects, I may be able to help.

I'm a âœ¨linux userâœ¨ too! (I use arch btw ïŒƒ ). Looking forward to helping the open source community as an arch ~~newbie ~~ MAIN ^_^
