# IMPORTANT INFO
This profile uses my school email. It's probably one of my biggest computer
science mistakes, using a school account as my main account. I will move my all
of my stuff to [RedFlameKen](https://github.com/redflameken). Unfortunately,
commits made on this account might not be transferred to my main one, so I'll
either make a new repo with all of the files commited there, or transfer the
repositories to the new account, keeping the commits on this account.

# Profile

As my first language, i'm very good at Java. So if you need help with your open source java projects, I may be able to help.

I'm a âœ¨linux userâœ¨ too! (I use arch btw ïŒƒ ). Looking forward to helping the open source community as an arch ~~newbie~~ MAIN ^_^
