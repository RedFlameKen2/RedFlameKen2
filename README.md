👋 Hello, I'm ✨RedFlameKen!✨ I'm from Pasay City, Philippines.

As my first language, i'm very good at Java. So if you need help with your open source java projects, I may be able to help.

I'm a linux user too! (I use arch btw  ). Looking forward to helping the open source community as an arch newbie ^_^
